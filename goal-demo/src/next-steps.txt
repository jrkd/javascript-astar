Can we pre-compute the graph nodes and edges based on the actions at the start?
- If we have a more legit graph with real world stuff, or even just if things about the worldstate are changing dynamically (eg outside the effects of the graph) can we do this?

Setup costs properly -- should be fairly straight forward. Test is to tweak them and see plan change. 

- the re-mapping of the path part way through will only work with both of these i think?

Our man setup priority of actions in a list -- easy to implement, but makes me wonder why we dont define a hueristic that describes "how much closer to the goal are we", "how far away from the start are we"
I suppose its hard to quantify this across different data structures that are all stored in the world state. hmm.


After all that, need to think about 
- actions that take time to execute 
- whether we'd need more complicated pre-conditions like hunger > 50, or effect move x over time..?
- think about how this would work when youve got multiple agents that all change the world, and a user that changes the world.
